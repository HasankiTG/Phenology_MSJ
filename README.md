# Phenology_MSJ

This repository is meant to support the manuscript: "The duration of high spring light for understory plants: contrasting responses to spatial and temporal temperature variation" by Gamhewa et al. (2025).

# Components
The repository contains seven R scripts.

For each understory species (Erythronium and Trillium)

1.Identifying the time periods for which temperature best explains phenology (model1_Erythronium and model1_Trillium)

2.The effect of temperature (spatial and temporal) on vegetative phenology across strata (model2_Eruthronium and model2_Trillium)

3.Temporal temperature fluctuations on vegetative phenology across strata at each elevation (model3_Erythronium and model3_Trillium)

4.Climate data


# How to use

This repository is meant to be a reasonbly well-documented record of the analyses carries out in the manuscript detailed above.
