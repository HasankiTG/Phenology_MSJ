# Phenology_MSJ

This repository is meant to support the manuscript:"The duration of high spring light for understory plants: contrasting responses to spatial and temporal temperature variation" by Gamhea et al. (2025) available at .....

# Components
The repository contains seven R scripts.

For each understory species (Erythronium and Trillium)

1.Identifying the time periods for which temperature best explains phenology

2.The effect of temperature (spatial and temporal) on vegetative phenology across strata

3.Temporal temperature fluctuations on vegetative phenology across strata at each elevation
